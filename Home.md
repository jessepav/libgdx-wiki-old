**Welcome to our Wiki, a place for comprehensive documentation on the libGDX API and features.** This wiki is community driven, and can be edited by anyone. If you find information out of date or want to add some more in-depth explanations, you are very welcome to do the necessary changes after having had a look at our [[Wiki Style Guide]].  

## Getting Started
#### If you want to get started coding with libGDX, head to the [Official documentation - here - ](https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/) to learn how to setup your environment and create/import your project.
